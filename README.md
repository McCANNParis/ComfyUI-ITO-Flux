# ComfyUI-ITO-Flux

**Information-Theoretic Optimization (ITO) for Flux Dev in ComfyUI**

A custom ComfyUI node that implements dynamic inference-time optimization for the Flux Dev model. ITO dynamically adjusts guidance strength during the denoising process based on the divergence between conditional and unconditional predictions, resulting in sharper details, better texture quality, and more natural images—all without any model retraining.

## Features

- **Dynamic Adaptive Guidance**: Automatically adjusts CFG scale based on prediction divergence
- **Multiple Divergence Metrics**: L2, Cosine, KL-approximation, and Frequency-domain
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Sigmoid, Linear, Exponential, and Polynomial guidance schedules
- **Flux-Specific Optimization**: Designed specifically for Flux Dev's architecture and flow matching
- **Debug Visualization**: Real-time metrics tracking and visualization
- **Production Ready**: Numerically stable, efficient, and well-documented

## What is ITO?

Information-Theoretic Optimization (ITO) is a technique that dynamically adjusts the classifier-free guidance (CFG) scale during inference based on how different the conditional and unconditional model predictions are at each step.

**Key Insight**: When predictions diverge significantly, higher guidance helps; when they're similar, lower guidance prevents over-saturation and artifacts.

### Benefits over Standard CFG

- **Better Detail Preservation**: Sharper textures in fabric, skin, hair
- **Reduced Artifacts**: Fewer CFG-related artifacts at high guidance values
- **More Natural Results**: Better color transitions and overall coherence
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Automatically optimizes guidance per-image and per-step

### Divergence Types

#### L2 (Recommended for most cases)
- Simple Euclidean distance
- Fast and efficient
- Works well across different image types

#### Cosine
- Measures directional similarity
- Scale-invariant
- Good for highly detailed images

#### KL Approximation
- Approximates KL divergence
- More theoretically grounded
- Better for probabilistic interpretation

#### Frequency
- Operates in frequency domain
- Emphasizes high-frequency details
- Best for texture-heavy images

### Schedule Types

#### Sigmoid (Recommended)
- Smooth S-curve transition
- Balanced response across divergence range
- Most stable and predictable

#### Linear
- Direct proportional mapping
- Simple and straightforward
- Good for testing

#### Exponential
- Aggressive response to high divergence
- Can produce more dramatic effects
- Use with caution

#### Polynomial
- Quadratic response curve
- Smooth low-end, sharper high-end
- Good middle ground

## Debug Mode

Enable `debug_mode` to receive:
- **Console output**: Step-by-step divergence and guidance values
- **Visualization plot**: Charts showing divergence and guidance evolution
- **Summary statistics**: Average values, ranges, and trends

The debug plot output can be connected to a `SaveImage` node for analysis.

## Advanced Features

### Guidance Schedule Visualizer

Use the **ITO Guidance Schedule Visualizer** node to preview how different schedule types and parameters affect the guidance curve before running a full sample.

**Inputs**:
- guidance_min, guidance_max
- schedule_type
- sensitivity
- num_points (resolution of visualization)

**Output**:
- Interactive plot showing guidance scale vs. normalized divergence

### Sensitivity Tuning

The `sensitivity` parameter controls how responsive the guidance is to divergence changes:

- **< 1.0**: More conservative, smaller adjustments
- **= 1.0**: Balanced (recommended starting point)
- **> 1.0**: More aggressive, larger adjustments

Higher sensitivity can produce more dramatic effects but may be less stable.

### Warmup Steps

Setting `warmup_steps > 0` forces maximum guidance for the first N steps. This can be useful when:
- Initial noise levels are very high
- You want consistent strong guidance early in sampling
- Testing shows benefit from delayed ITO activation

## Technical Details

### How ITO Works

1. **Dual Prediction**: At each sampling step, get both conditional and unconditional predictions
2. **Divergence Calculation**: Measure the difference using selected metric (L2, cosine, etc.)
3. **Normalization**: Normalize divergence to [0, 1] range using EMA statistics
4. **Schedule Mapping**: Map normalized divergence to guidance scale using schedule function
5. **Apply Guidance**: Use calculated guidance instead of fixed CFG
6. **Repeat**: Continue for all sampling steps

### Flux-Specific Adaptations

- **Flow Matching**: Adapted for Flux's flow matching instead of standard diffusion
- **Latent Format**: Handles Flux's specific latent tensor format
- **CFG Range**: Optimized for Flux's typical guidance range (1.0-4.0 vs SDXL's 7-9)
- **Timestep Handling**: Works with Flux's timestep embedding approach

### Performance

- **Overhead**: ~5-10% additional compute time vs standard sampling
- **Memory**: Minimal additional memory usage
- **Optimization**: Uses efficient PyTorch operations
- **Batching**: Maintains batch efficiency

## Troubleshooting

### Images look oversaturated
- Reduce `guidance_max`
- Lower `sensitivity`
- Try `schedule_type: polynomial` or `linear`

### Not enough difference from standard CFG
- Increase `sensitivity`
- Increase divergence range (`guidance_min` to `guidance_max`)
- Try `divergence_type: frequency`

### Unstable results
- Increase `smoothing_window`
- Add `warmup_steps`
- Reduce `sensitivity`
- Use `schedule_type: sigmoid`

### Black images or errors
- Check that you're using Flux Dev model
- Verify positive/negative conditioning is connected
- Ensure latent image is properly initialized
- Check ComfyUI console for error messages

### Comparing ITO vs Standard CFG

Run two parallel paths:
1. Standard KSampler with fixed CFG
2. ITO Flux Sampler with adaptive guidance

Use the same seed and compare outputs!
